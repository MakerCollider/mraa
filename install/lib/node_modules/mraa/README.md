libmraa - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms
==============

Libmraa_makercollider is a C/C++ library with bindings to javascript & python to interface
with Edison platforms, with a structured and sane
API where port names/numbering matches the board that you are on. This library is only used 
on Intel Edison platform, and we make some change to let the mraa library to adapter the 
extension board type, and now it support the Intel Edison Arduino extension board and makercollider
new breakout board

The intent is to make it easier for developers and sensor manufacturers to map
their sensors & actuators on top of supported hardware and to allow control of
low level communication protocol by high level languages & constructs.
